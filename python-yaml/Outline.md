# Intro
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you how to read and write YAML in python.
It's pretty handy, I end up doing it all the time, especially, updating a YAML file programmatically in place, which I'll cover last, has saved me so much time.

```
pip3 install pyyaml
pip3 show pyyaml
```

If you looking to learn more about building software, subscribe to the channel. If you want to learn more about Earthly, which is an open source build tool that works great wit python then check out the link in the descript. 

I work for Earthly and it's a great way to build things. It's sort of like docker for builds. Works locally and works with your existing CI and it has a generous free plan if you want a faster experience.
