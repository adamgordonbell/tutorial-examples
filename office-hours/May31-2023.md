## Intro

Hey, we are live.

Welcome to the inaguarl Earthly Office Hours. We will be distrubing this somewhere after the fact. Probably on youtube. So if you are watching this from the future on youtube.. ah hello from the past.

Today we are going to cover some of Earthly's latest released features... Evan is here to give a demo. Which I'm pretty sure is going to be a build race between GitHub Actions and Earthly. So stick around to see how that goes.

And then we are going to do community Q & A and answer questions.
