# Intro
Hey, in this video I'm going to tell you about Staff software engineers, but not the kind you'll find at google, or Amazon. This is the other kind of staff software engineer. 
If the talk goes well, then it might change your whole career tragectory.
But at the very least, you'll be entertained.


# Outro
If you've worked in a staff role, I'd love to hear about it in the comments. Especially if you can compare it to a line role. 

And If you looking to learn more about building software, subscribe to the channel. If you want to learn more about Earthly, which is like a make file brought into the future got to earthly.dev or check the link in the description. 

I work for Earthly and it's a great way to build things. It's sort of like docker for builds. Works locally and works with your existing CI.

 - If a staff role sound interesting. I have a couple of strategeies that I've seen work for making that type of shift.
- But first I want to tell you a little about Earthly.
- Earthly, is a open source build tool.
- No software developer likes their build pipeline.
- Nobody likes waiting for a build to finish, or rerunning things because the build is flaky.
- With Earthly, you write your build in a format similar to a Dockerfile, or a make file and you can run your build locally or in CI.
- You'd be surprized how big of a difference this can make and because the build runs in a container, it runs the same on your local as it does in CI. 
- It's like docker, but for CI. Go to EArthly.dev, or like in the description to check it out.
- Alright, now let me tell you about some strageies for finding a staff role
