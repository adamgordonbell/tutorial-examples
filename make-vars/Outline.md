# Outro

If you looking to learn more about building software, subscribe to the channel. If you want to learn more about Earthly, which is like a make file brought into the future got to earthly.dev or check the link in the description. 

I work for Earthly and it's a great way to build things. It's sort of like docker for builds. Works locally and works with your existing CI.
