# Intro
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you how variables work in make files. It might seem like a simple topic, but actually its a bit complex. Make files can get a little bit wild, and follw along with me today, and you'll be the expert at make files in no time.

Plan:
Mainly all the vars from here covered in existing makefile
https://earthly.dev/blog/undrstndng-and-usng-makefilevar/


Need to add wildcards and special vars from it, from these two, for a seperate video:

# Outro

If you looking to learn more about building software, subscribe to the channel. If you want to learn more about Earthly, which is like a makefile  but containerized the check out the link in the description or go to Earthly.dev.

Honestly, if you are this into make files, you are going to love Earthly.

brought into the future got to earthly.dev or check the link in the description. 

I work for Earthly and it's a great way to build things. It's sort of like docker for builds. Works locally and works with your existing CI.
