# Intro
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you how and why to use makefiles with go.
How to compile, run, test and clean using make.
And if you stay to the end, I'll share why makefiles are still a great choice and how they make a great task runner.


# Outro

If you looking to learn more about building software, subscribe to the channel. If you want to learn more about Earthly, which is like a make file brought into the future got to earthly.dev or check the link in the description. 

I work for Earthly and it's a great way to build things. It's sort of like docker for builds. Works locally and works with your existing CI.
